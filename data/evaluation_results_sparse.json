This species is heavily featured in European cave paintings , such as Lascaux and Chauvet Cave in France , and was still widespread during the Roman era . Following the fall of the Roman Empire , overhunting of the aurochs by nobility caused its population to dwindle to a single population in the Jaktorów forest in Poland , where the last wild one died in 1627 . However , because the aurochs is ancestral to most modern cattle breeds , it is possible for it to be brought back through selective or back breeding . The first attempt at this was by Heinz and Lutz Heck using modern cattle breeds , which resulted in the creation of Heck cattle . This breed has been introduced to nature preserves across Europe ; however , it differs strongly from the aurochs in physical characteristics , and some modern attempts claim to try to create an animal that is nearly",

    "generated_answer": "Father absence in a household can result in children ( of both sexes ) having earlier average ages of first sexual intercourse than those raised in father-present households . There is also the effect of increased rates of teenage pregnancy . Some evolutionary theories propose that early childhood is vital for encoding information that shapes future reproductive strategies in regulating physical and motivational pathways of sexual behavior . Conflicting and stressful parental relationships can lead children to believe that resources are limited . This is possible because in ancestral times the survival rate of children with mother being absent was extremely low . A study shows that there are fewer monitored meals in the father-absent household . Having meals in the family is arguably more beneficial to children than eating alone ( i.e . solitary eating ) , as the former lowers the chance of obesity . Moreover , proximity to a mother 's relatives ( matrilateral kin ) can dramatically improve female children 's height for age , an indicator of good nutrition . Women who return to their village of birth following marital dissolution are seen to benefit from extra matrilateral kin support . Presence of a",
