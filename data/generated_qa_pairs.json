The UN , UNESCO and Blue Shield International try to ensure effective protection at the national level and to intervene directly in the event of armed conflicts or disasters . This can particularly affect museums , archives , art collections and excavation sites . This should also secure the economic basis of a country , especially because works of art are often of tourist importance . The founding president of Blue Shield International , Karl von Habsburg , explained an additional connection between the destruction of cultural property and the cause of flight during a mission in Lebanon in April 2019 :  Cultural goods are part of the identity of the people who live in a certain place . If you destroy their culture , you also destroy their identity . Many people are uprooted , often no longer have any prospects and as a result flee from their homeland . '' In order to preserve the diversity of cultural identity , UNESCO protects the living human treasure through the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage .",
