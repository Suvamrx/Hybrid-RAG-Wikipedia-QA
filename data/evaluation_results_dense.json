Molecular engineering is highly interdisciplinary by nature , encompassing aspects of chemical engineering , materials science , bioengineering , electrical engineering , physics , mechanical engineering , and chemistry . Rather than relying on well-described but poorly-understood empirical correlations between the makeup of a system and its properties , a molecular design approach seeks to manipulate system properties directly using an understanding of their chemical and physical origins .

The first technologies dedicated to connect these displays and cameras were FPD-Link from National Semiconductor and GMSL from Maxim Integrated . GMSL was introduced in 2008 , and supported up to 3.125 Gb/s data rate in the downlink direction . This was sufficient to deliver uncompressed video from the head unit to high-definition displays commonly used in in-car entertainment systems , and to transport video from cameras to a CPU .

    "generated_answer": "Father absence in a household can result in children ( of both sexes ) having earlier average ages of first sexual intercourse than those raised in father-present households . There is also the effect of increased rates of teenage pregnancy . Some evolutionary theories propose that early childhood is vital for encoding information that shapes future reproductive strategies in regulating physical and motivational pathways of sexual behavior . Conflicting and stressful parental relationships can lead children to believe that resources are limited . This is possible because in ancestral times the survival rate of children with mother being absent was extremely low . A study shows that there are fewer monitored meals in the father-absent household . Having meals in the family is arguably more beneficial to children than eating alone ( i.e . solitary eating ) , as the former lowers the chance of obesity . Moreover , proximity to a mother 's relatives ( matrilateral kin ) can dramatically improve female children 's height for age , an indicator of good nutrition . Women who return to their village of birth following marital dissolution are seen to benefit from extra matrilateral kin support . Presence of a",
