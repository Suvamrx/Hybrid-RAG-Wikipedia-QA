Search engines influence democracy because of the potential distrust of media , leading to increasing online searches for political information and understanding . Through the use of a bias quantification framework , bias can be measured within political bias by rank within the search system .

A study shows that there are fewer monitored meals in the father-absent household . Having meals in the family is arguably more beneficial to children than eating alone ( i.e . solitary eating ) , as the former lowers the chance of obesity . Moreover , proximity to a mother 's relatives ( matrilateral kin ) can dramatically improve female children 's height for age , an indicator of good nutrition . Women who return to their village of birth following marital dissolution are seen to benefit from extra matrilateral kin support ."
